# Decimal to Binary
**Decimal** is the most common way a number is represented in the human language. Each digit in decimal represents that number times 10 to the power of it's index.

For example: 134 (in decimal) = 1*(10^2) + 3*(10^1) + 4*(10^0) = 134


**Binary** is commonly used in digital electronics. Each digit can only be a 0 or a 1, since it's a base-2 numeral system.

For example: 5 (in binary) = 1*(2^2) + 1*(2^0) = 101
