# Egyptian Fraction

An Egyptian fraction is a finite sum of distinct unit fractions, such as

1/2 +  1/3 + 1/16

That is, each fraction in the expression has a numerator equal to 1 and a denominator that is a positive integer, and all the denominators differ from each other. The value of an expression of this type is a positive rational number a/b; for instance the Egyptian fraction above sums to 43/48. Every positive rational number can be represented by an Egyptian fraction.

Egyptian Fraction Representation of 2/3 is 1/2 + 1/6
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 6/14 is 1/3 + 1/11 + 1/231
Egyptian Fraction Representation of 12/13 is 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/12 + 1/156

We can generate Egyptian Fractions using Greedy Algorithm.
