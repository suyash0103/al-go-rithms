Climbing Staricase
========================

You need to climb a staircase that has n steps, and you decide to get some extra exercise by jumping up the steps. 
You can cover at most k steps in a single jump. 
Return all the possible sequences of jumps that you could take to climb the staircase, sorted.


For n = 4 and k = 2, the output should be
[[1, 1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 2],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [2, 1, 1],
 [2, 2]]
