***Longest Palindromic Subsequence***

This problem is of finding the longest subsequences of a string that are also palindromic. The subsequences are not substrings and therefore, each character of the palindrome need not be adjecent to each other.

For example, in ABBDCACB, the longest palindromic subsequence is BCACB which has a length of 5.
