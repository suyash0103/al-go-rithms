<h2>Binary Tree</h2>


A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple <strong>(L, S, R)</strong>, where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set.
