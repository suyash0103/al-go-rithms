# Logistic Regression

**Logistic Regression** is a type of regression based supervised learning. Here, a "model" is built for predicting the output to some
corresponding input. Once the model is built, the model is trained using a **training set** that is obtained by dividing the given data/dataset
by some ratio, mostly 60:40, 80:20 etc. The remaining data, called the **testing set** is used to test the trained model and check for any outliers.


Logistic regression can be divided into:

**Binary classification based** Where the results of the classification problem results in one of two pre-defined outputs. Eg: 0 or 1

**Multi-class classification based** Where the results are more than just two types. Eg: 0, 1, 2, 3....This can be further classified into:
**One vs One**- Where 'n' models are built, compared and the maximum of the results is taken.
**One vs All**- Where 'n(n-1)/2' models are built, compared and the mode of the results is taken.
