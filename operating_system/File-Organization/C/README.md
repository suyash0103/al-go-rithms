<h1>File Organization</h1>

The directory structure is the organization of files into a hierarchy of folders. In a single-level directory system, all the files are placed in one directory. There is a root directory which has all files. It has a simple architectureand there are no sub directories. Advantage of single level directory system is that it is easy to find a file in thedirectory.
In the two-level directory system, each user has own user file directory (UFD). The system maintains a master block that has one entry for each user. This master block contains the addresses of the directory of the users. When a user job starts or a user logs in, the system's master file directory (MFD) is searched. When a user refers to a particular file, only his own UFD is searched. This effectively solves the name collision problem and isolates users from one another.
Hierarchical directory structure allows users to create their own subdirectories and to organize their files accordingly. A tree is the most common directory structure. The tree has a root directory, and every file in the system has a unique path name. A directory (or subdirectory) contains a set of files or subdirectories.
